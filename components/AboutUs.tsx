                    Hi, we’re Maya and Colin, the developers behind this app! When we first started dating, we loved
                    sharing recipes, video ideas, and coding tools with each other. But over time, we found it hard to
                    remember where we saved specific posts or shared our favorite finds. That’s when the idea for
                    Bookmarks was born! It became such a time-saver for us that, after a year of using it ourselves, we
                    decided to share it with the world. We hope it helps you as much as it’s helped us!
